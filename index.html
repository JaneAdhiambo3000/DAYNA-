            <h1>DAYNA</h1>
            <p>A web application that takes a user's birthday and calculates the day of the week they were born and
                then
                depending on their gender outputs their Akan Name. Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture.
                Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 'day name' which corresponds to the
                day in the week
                they
                were born.</p>
